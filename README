Welcome to the very basic version of a java client for the open data api of the NOS.
More information about the api can be found here:

http://open.nos.nl/

At the moment most of the requests that the api supports are implemented.

The v1 version is the exposed version of the api of the NOS

If you want to compile the project yourself and you want to run the integration test,
you need to ask for an api key and you have to create a file key.properties and put in
on your classpath. You can use the test/resources for instance. Put one property in the
file called key. Nice :-)
